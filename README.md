## Task and Expectation
In the attached file I have taken a ticket for code refactoring. The client wanted to make the Horiseon Home Page more accessible to those with disabilities. 

## Results
I met the accessibility standards by adding various semantics to the HTML which will allow browsers to identify and render the page with ease.

I have also simplified the style sheet by combining features with redundant styling elements into to similar classes. 

I also fixed a broken link at the top nav bar.

Overall, the web page looks the same as before but is now meets accessibility standards for the visually and auditory impaired. The overall code is also simplified and easier to read.
